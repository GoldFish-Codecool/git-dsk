### 6. Basic Libraries and Modules

Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules that provide additional functionalities beyond the core language. These can be imported into your program to extend its capabilities.

#### a. Importing

You can import a module or library using the `import` statement:

```python
import math

result = math.sqrt(25)
print(result)  # Outputs: 5.0
```

Key points:
- The `import` statement allows you to use functions and classes from external modules.
- Once imported, you can access its functions using the module name followed by a dot.

#### b. Common Libraries

Here are some basic libraries and their uses:

- **math**: Provides mathematical functions.
  
  ```python
  import math
  angle_in_radians = math.radians(180)
  ```

- **datetime**: Offers classes for manipulating dates and times.
  
  ```python
  from datetime import datetime
  current_time = datetime.now()
  print(current_time)
  ```

- **random**: Contains functions to generate random numbers.
  
  ```python
  import random
  random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
  print(random_number)
  ```

Key points:
- Python's standard library is vast, offering modules for various tasks.
- There are also many third-party libraries available that can be installed using package managers like `pip`.
