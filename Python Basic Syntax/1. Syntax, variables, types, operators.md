### 1. Python Basics

#### a. Syntax

Python is known for its readable syntax. Here's a basic structure of a Python program:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a message to the console
```

Key points:
- Comments start with a `#` and are ignored by the Python interpreter.
- Code is executed line by line.
- Indentation (using spaces or tabs) is crucial in Python, especially for defining code blocks.

#### b. Variables

Variables are used to store data values:

```python
name = "John"
age = 30
print(name)  # Outputs: John
print(age)   # Outputs: 30
```

Key points:
- Variables don't need to be declared with any particular type.
- You can reassign a variable to a new value or type at any time.

#### c. Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

```python
# Strings
text = "Hello"

# Integers
number = 10

# Floats (decimal numbers)
decimal_number = 20.5

# Lists (ordered, changeable collections)
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Dictionaries (unordered collections with key-value pairs)
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
```

Key points:
- Use the `type()` function to find out the type of a variable: `print(type(text))  # Outputs: <class 'str'>`

#### d. Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables:

```python
# Arithmetic operators
addition = 5 + 3  # 8
subtraction = 5 - 3  # 2
multiplication = 5 * 3  # 15
division = 8 / 2  # 4.0

# Comparison operators
is_equal = 5 == 3  # False
is_not_equal = 5 != 3  # True
```

Key points:
- Python supports a variety of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and more.
