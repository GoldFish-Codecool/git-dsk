### 5. Error Handling

Errors are bound to happen in your code, especially when dealing with unpredictable user input or external data sources. Python provides mechanisms to handle these errors gracefully without crashing your program.

#### a. Basic Exception Handling

Using `try` and `except` blocks, you can catch and handle exceptions (errors) that might occur during the execution of your program:

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / number
    print("Result is:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
```

Key points:
- The code inside the `try` block is executed first.
- If an error occurs, the code inside the corresponding `except` block is executed.
- Multiple `except` blocks can be used to handle different types of errors.

Error handling is essential for creating robust programs that can deal with unexpected situations. It improves the user experience by providing meaningful error messages instead of crashing unexpectedly.
