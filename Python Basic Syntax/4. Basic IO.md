### 4. Basic Input/Output

#### a. Reading Input

To interact with users, you can use the `input()` function to read input from the console:

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
```

Key points:
- The `input()` function displays a prompt to the user and waits for them to type something.
- The entered text is returned as a string.

#### b. Printing Output

The `print()` function is used to display information to the console:

```python
age = 25
print("I am", age, "years old.")  # Outputs: I am 25 years old.
```

Key points:
- The `print()` function can take multiple arguments and will concatenate them into a single string.
- It can also handle different data types, converting them to strings as needed.

Basic input and output operations are crucial for creating interactive programs. They allow your code to communicate with the user, gather data, and display results.
