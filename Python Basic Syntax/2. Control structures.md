### 2. Control Structures

#### a. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

```python
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just became an adult!")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

Key points:
- The `if` statement checks a condition, and if it's `True`, the code inside its block is executed.
- The `elif` (short for "else if") checks another condition if the previous conditions were not met.
- The `else` block is executed if none of the previous conditions were met.

#### b. Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.

**For Loop**:

```python
# Looping through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**While Loop**:

```python
# Printing numbers from 1 to 5
number = 1
while number <= 5:
    print(number)
    number += 1
```

Key points:
- The `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list or a string).
- The `while` loop keeps executing its block as long as its condition is `True`.

Control structures are fundamental in programming as they allow for decision-making and repetition based on conditions. They form the backbone of most algorithms and program flows.
