### 3. Functions

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs.

#### a. Defining Functions

You can define a function using the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

Key points:
- The function `greet` takes a parameter `name`.
- The `return` statement sends a result back to the caller.

#### b. Calling Functions

Once a function is defined, you can call (or invoke) it from other parts of your code:

```python
def square(number):
    return number * number

result = square(4)
print(result)  # Outputs: 16
```

Key points:
- To call a function, use its name followed by parentheses `()`.
- If the function requires arguments, provide them inside the parentheses.

#### c. Built-in Functions

Python comes with many built-in functions that are readily available:

```python
# Finding the length of a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
length = len(fruits)
print(length)  # Outputs: 3

# Getting user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

You can check the full list of built-in functions in the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

For more functions, there is the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) and there are thousands more [third-party packages](https://pypi.org/) available.

Key points:
- Built-in functions, like `len()` and `input()`, provide common functionalities without the need to define them yourself.
- There are many other built-in functions in Python for various tasks.

Functions are essential in programming as they allow for modular and organized code. They help in breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
