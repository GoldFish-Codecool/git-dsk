Work in progress: Classes and main methods are defined. Items are posted in a .csv file.
Next steps: develop a simple user interface to prompt entry of items and calculation of revenue (in current version there are 3 items that get automatically processed when executing the program)
Project was developed in PyCharm, need to check if folder structure works after copying to GitHub
